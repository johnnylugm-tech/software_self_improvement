Score Aggregation: Computes weighted overall score from per-dimension scores

Identifies failing dimensions sorted by impact (gap × normalized_weight).
Outputs JSON with overall_score, meets_target, failing_dimensions, breakdown.

Issue-driven completion: surfaces open_critical_count / open_high_count from
the issue registry so early-stop can gate on quality, not score alone.
